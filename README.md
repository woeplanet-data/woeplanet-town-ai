_Forking GeoPlanet one place at a time ..._

Where On Earth (WOE) / Yahoo! GeoPlanet data reconstituted from the original GeoPlanet Data dumps with added metadata, some but not all of the original hierarchy linkages rebuilt, some but not all coordinates and boundaries restored (so, basically centroids and polygons) and formatted as GeoJSON with one file per WOEID.

This repository contains **Town** place records (placetype 7) in **Anguilla**.

For more information, see this [README](https://github.com/woeplanet-data/woeplanet-data/blob/master/README.md) file. For issues and bug reporting, please see the issues page for the [woeplanet-data/woeplanet-data](https://github.com/woeplanet-data/woeplanet-data/issues) repo.
